# Rust3D

Hey !!! This is my first Rust program (and also another attempt to create a 3D game engine with vulkan... yes, again)

## Features

- Nothing much now (only a very basic renderer)

## Planned features

- improved debugging features
- bindless descriptors
- Scene graph
- Assets / scene serialisation
- Wayland / XFace / Cocoa backend
- Metal backend for OSx
- Audio integration
- Physic engine
- Improve shader compiler by using a better lexer
- Add glsl support

And of course !
- Some nice projects using this game engine
