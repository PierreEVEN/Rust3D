# Rust3D

Heeyyyyy !!! ðŸ™Œ
This is my first Rust program (and also another attempt to create a 3D game engine using vulkan... yes, again)

## Features

- Vulkan backend
- Win32 backend
- Runtime ecs

- logger
- Custom Hlsl based shader language that support specification of render passes and multiple stages
- Dynamic framegraph with resource recycling

## Planned features

- Improve framegraph resource recycling
- frame profiler & debugger
- Scene graph
- Assets / scene serialisation
- Wayland / XFace / Cocoa backend
- OpenGL backend for low end devices
- Metal backend for OSx
- Audio engine
- Physic engine
- Add glsl support
- 3D math library
- Large world coordinate support
- Compute shaders
- Network
- Internal UI system

And of course !
- Some nice projects using this game engine
